 AP_START_SCREEN_CHILDREN_OF_THE_DARKNESS:0 "Since the beginning of our civilization has the surface of [GetHomeWorldName] been alive with our natural predators. While our people had hard times learning to live among the surface dwellers they often hid inside some of the more common caves on the planet. They learned fast that these went deeper then expected and held the ability to foster live we bent to our survival.\n\nMany centuries have passed since those lessons have been learned, while most retreated towards the depths those few that remained died out. Reasuring our previous expepectations. Now with a vast network of caves having littered the planet and us having used our technology to reclaim the surface we now turn our gaze up further.

They gained knowledge on a level far beyond what they could even comprehend. The sheer madness that seeded caused these people to try and destroy the relics. Yet in the fracturing of this knowledge they left the pieces accross the entire planet. Seeding the early nations of [GetHomeWorldName] with many abilities.\n\n After great conflict and the realization our knowledge is based on another civilization lost to us. We banded together in a collective which would later grow into our current empire. The knowledge gleamed in our early years gave us much to ponder."

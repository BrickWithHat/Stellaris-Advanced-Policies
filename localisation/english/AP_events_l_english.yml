In doing so the world of §Y[Root.GetName]§! had peeked many eyes. To that end we and set up a plan to begin a schedule of gathering extra material and labor from this world."
 AP_PQ.1_autocrate_desc:0 "We send our demands towards the planet of §Y[Root.GetName]§! to increase our material gain from this world. As we speak they appear to be processing this request and are fully ontop of it. It shall be interesting indeed to hear there decisions in this. As it is expected most rulers of this world are unlikely to give up there material wealth with ease."
 AP_PQ.1_remaining_desc:0 "We called upon the rulers of §Y[Root.GetName]§! see about getting a Quota enacted. As our empire always can use more material. We will be sending our plans towards the local leaders within the hour. While they mule over it trying to plan it out for further details we should work on our empire as a whole."
 AP_PQ.1_ega_desc:0 "With the declaration having passed and becoming public. Many are questioning the motive of our decree. While the opposition has called it an attempt to undermine our true valeau's our people are eager to hear it purpose.

 AP_PQ.2_fail:0 "Our goal to gather more material and labor from §Y[Root.GetName]§! has failed. While we did manage to gain a sizable amount of material from the raw production we still did not reach our goal. Maybe next time it comes to pass we may be better equiped to deal with the problems that crippled us in our time of need."
 AP_PQ.2_fail_1:0 "We did what we could."

 AP_PQ.2_abolish:0 "We ended our decree of the planetary quota of §Y[Root.GetName]§!. As this change is taking effect the people rejoiced. Not having to toil any longer for extended hours. Though the loss of the resources might be considerable, the loss of our people is even less acceptable."
 AP_PQ.2_abolish_1:0 "Our people must be presurved for our future after all."

 AP_PQ.2_success:0 "With the completion of our schedule we now have reached the end of the quota. As it stands we have completed our goal and gathered warehouses full of material. These are being shipped accros our empire as we speak. What is most interesting however, is that going back to the before stance was not recommended by the local leaders. They recommended a transition phase to get them accustomed back to normal life. This will both give us more material and please the populace. Thus this recommendation has been enacted and implemented with early results showing a clear rise in the happiness of the people of §Y[Root.GetName]§!!"
 AP_PQ.2_success_1:0 "Wonderfull!"

Thus leaving only meager pickings for our factories. We may need to either dismiss some troops to return and work the factories or find other alternatives. What ever it is we have limeted time to get around to it as the quota is about to start in around a month time."

Yet all is not perfect, we have gained reports of our overseers on site that they are expecting the local infrastructure to become a bottleneck soon. While the planet definatly has sufficient infrastructure any breakdown could cause massive delays."

So far no mayor delays have been granted. In fact at this point we are even slightly ahead of schedule. With this there war effort has greatly been boosted. Let us hope they continue with this wonderfull progress."
 AP_PQ.203_fail_desc:0 "With the lack of labor on the planet we appear to be unable to reach our full potential. While the administration and logistics can keep up. Our factories simply do not hold the right people for the right jobs. As such we have fallen behind on the schedule set out. The effects of which are still uncertain at this junction. Let us hope that the overal impact is not too severe."

 AP_PQ.206_pass_desc:0 "With a solid period of strike having come to pass, the world of §Y[Root.GetName]§! has finally come to a more calm state.

 AP_PQ.206_fail_desc:0 "With the recent protests having been underway for a solid while now, the world of §Y[Root.GetName]§! seems to have entered a new phase. One of anarchy and a severe lack of law. With many deserting there posts to loot and pillage what is left.

 AP_PQ.300_desc:0 "The plans for our material quota has been send to the world of §Y[Root.GetName]§!, the local rulers have shown great interest in our demand. They appear to be eager to exploit the populace for more material and labor. However there have been a few requesting caution in the process. There fears are mainly caused by there own experience with lacking recruitment pools of specialist workers. Something which they do claim is something they can overcome with some time."

 AP_PQ.303_title:0 "Planetary Quota: A cause worth working for?"
 AP_PQ.303_desc:0 "We have gained a new report from §Y[Root.GetName]§! regarding our Quota. It does appear as if our total productivity on the planet is starting to drop. Some speculation has been attached to the report regarding the possible cause of this. Most evidence hints that the populace sees little reason to work more then is needed to survive. As a result they only do the bare minimum before then leaving. This has slowed the economy and production of §Y[Root.GetName]§! significintly."
 AP_PQ.303_1:0 "A minor set-back nothing to worry about."
 AP_PQ.303_2:0 "Maybe we should give them something genuine for there work."

Firstly we have managed to begin phase 2 of this project with in related news our workers do appear as to not give it there all anymore. It looks like they simply have lost most reason to work as hard as they used to. Productivity is now at an all time low since the Quota was enacted. While the rulers of §Y[Root.GetName]§! are confident they can sort this out they do not have any clue about how long it will take. During which this will effect our plans for the Quota rather harshly. "

 AP_PQ.305_title:0 "Planetary Quota: A cause"
 AP_PQ.305_desc:0 "We have a new devolpment regarding the workers attitude on the planet §Y[Root.GetName]§!. It appears that most if not all have regained there senses and returned back to there normal lives. With productivity having returned to it norm before this odd phenomenon took place.

Yet moments before there were ment to leave, it somehow got hijacked by a third party. While the crew is unharmed the vessels and all it contents appears to be lost to us. Local law enforcement appears to be onto of it but with little to go on. We fear this entire shipment might be lost to us."

 AP_PQ.402_desc:0 "We recently got a report from a low ranking offical on §Y[Root.GetName]§! claiming the reports send by there higher-ups are false. The report claims that a lot of material and resources and even people are dissapearing. His report indicates that some criminal elements have been operating with those materials and growing from this wealth. This suggests that our administrators on §Y[Root.GetName]§! are either corrupt to the core or complecent in the extreme."

 AP_pop.11_desc:0 "Recent events regarding the rogue elements of the politcal party of §Y[Root.GetPopFactionName]§! have been troubling. As it appears as if they are trying to gather arms. The blackmarket that trade in them are buzzing with activity to fill there demand, causing our enforcers to work overtime. While we intercept many of these mostly small arms. The fact remains that they are clearly up to something. People do not arm themselfs for no reason. The fact it is also highly illegal to own fire-arms with out the proper clearance makes this a grave offence in the court of law. \n In responds a special task-force has been assembled and send forward to locate and capture any and all involved in this arms-dealing. So far they have had massive success yet there sources are turning dry with very little proof of who made the purchase. We should tread carefull as a means of avoiding potential revolution from within our own ranks."

 AP_panic.2_title:0 "Troop Surplus"
 AP_panic.2_desc:0 "As recent battle has been shown to the public as a whole.

 AP_panic.3_title:0 "Rumbles from below"

 AP_panic.3_1:0 "Unfortunate"

 AP_panic.4_title:0 "Unexpected visitors."
 AP_panic.4_desc:0 "Today marks a unique day, As there is a sudden yet organized strike taking place near the government building. This strike appears to delve into a large group of issues related to our empire. Most of these people do not even appear to be from our capital world. Regardless where they came from, they have layed down there work and are clearly obstructing others on the capital world as is. We sadly cannot do much about these strikes as even our officers and military personal appear to be stuck where they are due to the vast sea of people."
 AP_panic.4_1:0 "That are indeed a lot of people."

 AP_panic.5_title:0 "Echo of Discord"
 AP_panic.5_desc:0 "Our collective has been disrupted, Something out in our space is calling to us. Faintly yet ever present. Whatever it might be it is not one of us that is the only thing we know.\n \nThe everlingering presence is eating awey at us however. We should consider investiging or lose our cohesion."
 AP_panic.5_1:0 "Ignore, we cannot afford to investigate"
 AP_panic.5_2:0 "Investigate we cannot risk the danger"

 AP_panic.51_title:0 "Discorded Patterns"
 AP_panic.51_desc:0 "The root of our discorded patterns has been found, an artifact was drifting through our space emitting a strange signal. From its markings it clearly is fabircated by someone or something advanced. Yet even in our labs it clearly is causing harm to us.\n \nWhile they are unable to trace back who made it, the question still remains what to do with it. We could try and open it and unlock its secrets or alternatively let someone else worry about it and restore our unity."
 AP_panic.51_1:0 "This is not worth our effort, get it out of our space"
 AP_panic.51_2:0 "Get our researchers to open it"

 AP_panic.6_title:0 "Waining Influence"
 AP_panic.6_desc:0 "Due to our focus on war and our aggrasive posture many empires have choosen to cut ties with us.

If we wish to hold any political relevance we should change our ways."
 AP_panic.6_1:0 "How about, No"
 AP_panic.6_2:0 "Maybe they are right..."

 AP_panic.7_title:0 "Drying the Rations"
 AP_panic.7_desc:0 "We have recieved a dozen or so messages from accros our empire that a good chunck of the argicultural sector is about to lay down there work in protest. While they represent a good chunck of the population. From our estimate they would take about 45% of our total food income with them during these protests."
 AP_panic.7_desc_gestalt:0 "The galaxy weeps, our crops die as a result. We are unsure what is causing the lack of balance in our collective. But the lack of it causes even the ground beneath our feet to die. We are losing the crops before they are even fully matured."

 AP_panic.8_title:0 "Consumer Sabotage"

With a big chunk of them not even arriving as scheduled if at all."
 AP_panic.8_1:0 "And so people suffer due to inefficiency"

 AP_panic.9_title:0 "Poor Material"
 AP_panic.9_desc:0 "Our measures have proven to be more draconian then expected as our ships in orbit have reported an increase in failed repairs. While initially not so odd, the frequancy had let to an investigation. Which has come up with a harrowing conclusion. We are prioritizing our materials wrongly, thus leading to inferior materials being used in the repairs.\n\nThe effect this has had on our fleet supply chain is proving to be a costly one. As about half of the new alloys are being shipped off to our fleets just to keep them functional."
 AP_panic.9_1:0 "I guess, a ship with a hole did not work on an ocean so it probably won't work in space either."

 AP_panic.10_title:0 "Job Security in peril"
 AP_panic.10_desc:0 "With the recent policy changes and the emergency measures in effect, a lot of people have had trouble keeping there jobs.

 AP_panic.12_title:0 "Minerals Missing"
 AP_panic.12_desc:0 "We have recieved reports that our mining operations and mineral purification facilities have undergone a labour shortage, This has caused many issues which effect our economy. While many unique reports have begun to show there head some just show sheer incompetiance. A truly perplexing situation was where a mining vessel managed to lose a pure asteriod of valueable minerals. How is yet to be determent but the achievement is sadly only the tip of the iceberg for our economic problems to come froth from all these increasing problems."
 AP_panic.12_1:0 "How did you lose rocks of that size?!"

 AP_panic.13_title:0 "Energy Crisis"
 AP_panic.13_desc:0 "Due to increased demands and pressuare set upon by our emergency measures, we are now unable to fully unitilize our energy production capabilities.
